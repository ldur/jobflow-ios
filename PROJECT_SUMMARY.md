## 🎨 Design Patterns

### MVVM Architecture
```
View ←→ ViewModel ←→ Service ←→ Model
```

### Singleton Pattern
- `SupabaseService.shared` - Single instance for app-wide access

### Observer Pattern
- `@Published` properties in ViewModels
- SwiftUI automatic view updates

### Repository Pattern
- `SupabaseService` acts as data repository
- Abstracts backend implementation

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Credential Management**
   - Environment variables for sensitive data
   - `.gitignore` prevents committing secrets
   - Config file template provided

2. **Authentication**
   - Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Secure session storage

3. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS-only communication
   - App Transport Security configured
   - Domain whitelisting in Info.plist

4. **Data Access**
   - Row Level Security enforced by backend
   - User can only see their assigned jobs

## 📱 User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- Loading spinners during operations
- Success/error toasts
- Progress bars for job completion
- Status badges with colors
- Completion timestamps

### Navigation
- Intuitive drill-down navigation
- Back buttons with proper flow
- Modal sheets for media viewing
- Pull-to-refresh on lists

### Accessibility
- Semantic views for VoiceOver
