# JobFlow iOS Documentation

## Overview

JobFlow is a modern iOS application built with SwiftUI that provides comprehensive job and workflow management capabilities. The app enables users to manage jobs, track action completion, and maintain workflow sequences with real-time synchronization through Supabase backend integration.

## Key Features

- **Job Management**: Create, assign, and track jobs with detailed progress monitoring
- **Action Workflows**: Sequential action completion with strict ordering enforcement
- **Real-time Sync**: Seamless data synchronization across devices via Supabase
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in/sign-up with session management
- **Media Support**: Attach images, videos, and audio to workflow actions
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual completion indicators and percentage tracking
- **Profile Management**: User profiles with role-based access control

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: SwiftUI with MVVM architecture
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Real-time)
- **Language**: Swift 5.9+
- **Minimum iOS**: 16.0+
- **Dependencies**: Supabase Swift SDK, Combine framework

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Xcode 15.0+, iOS 16.0+ device/simulator
2. **Setup**: Clone the repository and open `JobFlow.xcodeproj`
3. **Configuration**: Update Supabase credentials in `Config.xcconfig`
4. **Build**: Select target device and build the project
